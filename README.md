## What I created

Made a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Mona Mostafa](https://dribbble.com/shots/21519144-BMI-Calculator?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=monaamostafaa&utm_content=BMI%20Calculator&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=monaamostafaa&utm_content=BMI%20Calculator&utm_medium=Social_Share).
